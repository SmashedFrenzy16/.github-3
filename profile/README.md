[ChesslaBlab](https://www.chesslablab.com) allows to learn and play chess online without being tracked. This is made possible because it does not use cookies of any sort and does not store information as other apps do, not even nicknames or chess games.

ChesslaBlab actually stands for chess laboratory.

It is open-source, and can be used and extended by developers to create amazing chess web apps. A bunch of public chess repos ranging from React and JavaScript to PHP are available on the ChesslaBlab community on GitHub.

> Chess involves quite a few different aspects of software development, which makes it a perfect topic for learning full-stack web development as well as for playing around with machine learning libraries.

Happy coding and learning!
